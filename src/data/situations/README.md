# Situations Data

This directory contains JSON files for each situation used in the application.

Each situation is stored in its own file, making it easier to:
- Add new situations
- Edit existing situations
- Maintain the codebase
- Improve loading performance through lazy loading

## File Structure

Each situation file follows this naming convention: `[situation-id].json`

For example:
- `restaurante.json`
- `hotel.json`
- `transporte.json`

## Adding New Situations

To add a new situation, simply create a new JSON file in this directory following the existing structure.
