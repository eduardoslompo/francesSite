# Quiz Data Directory

This directory contains JSON files for quizzes used in the application.

Each quiz is stored as a separate JSON file with a standardized structure that includes:
- Quiz metadata (title, description, level, etc.)
- Questions with options and correct answers
- Additional information like explanations and categories

This approach allows for easy management and addition of new quizzes through the admin dashboard.
